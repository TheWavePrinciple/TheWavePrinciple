-👋 Hi, I’m @TheWavePrinciple
- 👀 I’m interested in the fabric of space and the dimensions of time / sacred geometry. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and illustrating the new laws of physics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on energy, manufacturing, medicine, everything relates to natures law of coaxial circuits aka Wave Principle. 
- 📫 How to reach me? I need to set up a new contact email and phone #. Right now you can contact me through git-hub here.
- 😄 It's gonna take me some time to add more information here and make it clearer what this is all about.
- I have a ton of things to take care of right now but as soon as I'm able I will re build the library, I will start posting all the new discoveries. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: We've just illustrated how the geometric shapes of platonic solids emerge from the laws which govern wave construction. 
- ⚡ Fun fact, The forces that bind reality first described in the Emerald Tablets, Re discovered by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the first wave
Principle 90 years ago are now re realized,corrected and re illustrated and updated. 

This is a glimpse into the coaxial circuits that are the fundamental building blocks of space and time.
So far we've only been using it to rinse the stock market, but beyond that there's going to be major applications 
for every industry of science, technology, transport, energy, probably healthcare and beyond. 
The A.I. is raving about the possible applications of these new laws.
